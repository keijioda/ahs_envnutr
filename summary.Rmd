## Dataset
* File path: `M:\Groups\Nutrition\Environmental Nutrition\AHS-2 Environment and Health`
* File Name: `baseline-environmental-data-per-subject-20210824.csv`

* Includes *n* = `r nrow(ev)` subjects and
* 187 variables:
  * Demographics:
    * Age at baseline: `agein`
    * BMI: `bmi`
    * Education, 3 levels: `edu3cat`
    * Gender: `female`
    * Race (Black/Non-Black): `black`
  * Total intake in kcal, gram and servings per day
  * 28 food groups in:
    * kcal/day: `*_kcal`
    * gram/day: `*_gram`
    * standard servings/day: `*_srv`
    * GWP (kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq): `*_gw_kg`
    * land use (m²a): `*_lu_m2`
    * water consumption (m³): `*_wc_m3`
    * (replace * with food group name -- see below)
* There are 28 food groups:

```{r echo = FALSE}
fg_name
```

### Issues

* Environmental variables of cereal (`cereal_gw_kg`, `cereal_lu_m2`, `cereal_wc_m3`) have all zero values. AM has been notified.

### Changes

* More subjects (+12,000) included.
* `pork` and `beef` intakes are now separated.
* All food group variables (`*_kcal`, `*_gram`, `*_srv`, `*_gw_kg`, `*_lu_m2`, `*_wc_m3`) were winsorized at the 99.9th percentile of each variable. Total `kcal`, `gram`, `srv`, `gw_kg`, `lu_m2`, and `wc_m3` were recalculated by summing across 28 food groups after winsorization.

## Demographics

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Demographics table, unstratified
ev %>% 
  CreateTableOne(demo_vars, data = .) %>% 
  print(showAllLevels = TRUE)
```

## Total food intake
* Distributions of total intake in kcal, gram and servings per day
  * It appears that those with kcal <500 or >4500 are already excluded.
  * The max gram intake became more reasonable after winsorizing data.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Distribution of total intake
ev %>% 
  select(kcal, gram, srv) %>% 
  psych::describe(quant=c(.25,.75)) %>% 
  rename(Q1 = Q0.25, Q3 = Q0.75) %>% 
  select(min, Q1, median, Q3, max, mean, sd, skew)
```

## Total environmental impact
* Distributions of total GWP, land use and water consumption are right-skewed:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2.3}
# Distribution of total env impact
ev %>% 
  select(gw_kg, lu_m2, wc_m3) %>% 
  # mutate_all(log) %>% 
  psych::describe(quant=c(.25,.75)) %>% 
  rename(Q1 = Q0.25, Q3 = Q0.75) %>% 
  select(min, Q1, median, Q3, max, mean, sd, skew)

ev %>% 
  select(gw_kg, lu_m2, wc_m3) %>% 
  pivot_longer(gw_kg:wc_m3, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") %>% 
  mutate(variable = factor(variable, levels = c("gw_kg", "lu_m2", "wc_m3"))) %>% 
  # mutate_if(is.numeric, log) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free")

```

## Mean plots of environmental impact by food group

```{r echo = FALSE}

# Mean plots of environmental variables by food groups
MeanPlot <- function(data, vars){
  data %>% 
    select(all_of(vars)) %>% 
    summarize_all(mean) %>% 
    pivot_longer(all_of(vars), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Mean") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Variable, Mean), y = Mean)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "Food group")
}

```

* Mean GWP by food group: The consumption of `dairy` contributes to the largest GWP, followed by `beef` and `water`, among 28 food groups.

* Mean land use by food group: `dairy` followed by `veg`, `legumes` and `whlgrain`.

* Mean water consumption by food group: `fvjuice`, followed by `veg` and `fruit`.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
ev %>% MeanPlot(gwp_vars)
ev %>% MeanPlot(lu_vars)
ev %>% MeanPlot(wc_vars)
```

## Contribution of food groups (%) over total energy intake

* Percent contribution of food groups, in terms of kcal, GWP, land use, and water consumption, was calculated for each subjects and plotted against the total energy intake. Graphs below show a smoothed trend over the total kcal for each food group.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pct_ev_plot <- function(data, vars, denominator, label){
  denominator <- sym(denominator)
  ylab <- paste("Food group", label, "/ Total", label, "* 100")
  tmp <- data %>% 
    mutate_at(all_of(vars), ~ .x / !!denominator * 100) %>% 
    pivot_longer(all_of(vars[-28]), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value") %>% 
    mutate(Variable = factor(Variable, levels = vars[-28])) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = kcal, y = Value, color = Variable)) +
    geom_smooth() + 
    labs(x = "Total energy intake (kcal) per day", y = ylab)
  # tmp  + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
  tmp + facet_wrap(~Variable, ncol = 7) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
}

```

* Kcal: `fruit` intake explains >10% of the total energy intake. However, as the total energy increases, % kcal from `whlgrain` increases to >15%. The proportion of `dairy` in terms of kcal remains constant at ~7.5%.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
ev %>% pct_ev_plot(kcal_vars, "kcal", "Kcal")
```

* GWP: Again, you see the GWP of `dairy` intake is the highest among all food groups. Although % kcal of `dairy` is constant, its GWP appears to be positively associated with total kcal, plateauing around 18% of total GWP. The GWP of `water` quickly declines as kcal increases.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
ev %>% pct_ev_plot(gwp_vars, "gw_kg", "GWP")
```

\newpage

* Land use: Again, you see the land uses of `dairy`, `veg`, and `legumes` are higher than other food groups.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
ev %>% pct_ev_plot(lu_vars, "lu_m2", "LU")
```

* Water consumption: Again, you see the water consumptions of `fruit`, `fvjuice`, and `veg` are higher than other food groups. For other food groups, water consumption remains very low.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
ev %>% pct_ev_plot(wc_vars, "wc_m3", "WC")
```
